<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I'm Anamika Tripathi, currently learning to be a Full-Stack Web Developer. I'm from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. My highest qualification is Bachelors in Computer Application that I've completed from Arka Jain University, Jamshedpur. I've done Diploma in Computer Science Engineering from Government Women's Polytechnic. </p>

<p>I've done an internship in Web Development in 2020 from Adityapur Auto Cluster. There I was taught to build basic websites/webpages using Html, Css, Java Script, Php, Sql. I made various projects with the help of that knowledge such as E-commerce websites, A Quiz Game, Students Data Registry, etc.</p>

<p>Apart from being a Web Developer I also have interest in always learning about Cyber Security, Open.ai platforms (LLMs), different Bots that can make our life way more easier. Looking forward to learning more.</p>
<p>Good Bye!</p>
